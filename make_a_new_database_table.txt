1. php artisan make:model -m -s
that generates the php file, as well as the migration and seeder

2. edit the migration to include the desired columns

3. php artisan migrate
tables will now appear in database

4. set up relationships by editing the migrations
i added $table->bigInteger('category_id')->unsigned()->nullable(); to the food_item table migration
to give it a relationship to food_category table. Then in the models: 
class FoodCategory extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'food_categories';
    public function food_items() {
        return $this->hasMany('App\FoodItem', 'category_id')
    }
}
class FoodItem extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'food_items';
    return $this.belongsTo('App\FoodCategory');
}

establishes one to many relationship. every category has multiple food items.


5. php artisan migrate:refresh --seed

6. add this to fooditems migration: 
Schema::table('food_items', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->foreign('category_id')->references('id')->on('food_categories')->onDelete('set null');
});

7. php artisan migrate:refresh --seed


8. the tables are ready npw and you can work on the seeders.
